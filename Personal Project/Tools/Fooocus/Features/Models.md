By default it uses the SAM ([website](https://segment-anything.com/), [repository](https://segment-anything.com/)) masking model, backed by GroundingDINO ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05499), [diffusers docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/grounding-dino)), but offers support for all additional models currently supported by RemBG ([repository](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg?tab=readme-ov-file#models)). GroundingDINO + SAM do not use RemBG as handler, but have natively been implemented into focus for even better results and increased level control.

Currently supported models:

- SAM + GroundingDINO (default): A model combination which allows detection prompts and segmentation of objects in detected boxes in 3 variants ([base (default)](https://huggingface.co/mashb1t/misc/resolve/main/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth), [large](https://huggingface.co/mashb1t/misc/resolve/main/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth), [huge](https://huggingface.co/mashb1t/misc/resolve/main/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth))
- u2net ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net.onnx), [source](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net)): A pre-trained model for general use cases.
- u2netp ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2netp.onnx), [source](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net)): A lightweight version of u2net model.
- u2net_human_seg ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net_human_seg.onnx), [source](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net)): A pre-trained model for human segmentation.
- u2net_cloth_seg ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/u2net_cloth_seg.onnx), [source](https://github.com/levindabhi/cloth-segmentation)): A pre-trained model for Cloths Parsing from human portrait. Here clothes are parsed into 3 category: Upper body, Lower body and Full body.
- silueta ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/silueta.onnx), [Model size reduced to 43Mb! and new Webapp xuebinqin/U-2-Net#295](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net/issues/295)): Same as u2net but the size is reduced to 43Mb.
- isnet-general-use ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/isnet-general-use.onnx), [source](https://github.com/xuebinqin/DIS)): A new pre-trained model for general use cases.
- isnet-anime ([download](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/download/v0.0.0/isnet-anime.onnx), [source](https://github.com/SkyTNT/anime-segmentation)): A high-accuracy segmentation for anime character.
