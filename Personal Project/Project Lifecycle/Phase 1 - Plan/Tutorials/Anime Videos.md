- Script Writing with ChatGPT - READY TO USE PROMPT (COPY PASTE)
    

  

- Prompt: I’m going to create a 20 second animation about self improvement. I want you to create a motivational quote based on a Stoic principle I can use as a voiceover for this animation. Use modern simple words. Avoid hyperbolic language. Incorporate an analogy in this quote. Make the quote around 6 sentences long.  
    Use the following quote as reference:
    

“It’s easy to have faith when everything is working out. It’s much harder to have faith when you are facing challenges in your life. But that is exactly when you need to apply your faith. Because faith is believing in the unseen. Faith is taking the first step. Faith is jumping in the deep end and knowing everything will be okay. Remember, true faith shines brightest in the darkest moments.”
