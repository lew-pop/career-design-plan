# An Agile Approach to Starting a Career

## Repository Overview
Welcome to my Career Project Design Repository! This repository is a structured collection of my notes, design plans, and project management artifacts. It serves as a personal blueprint to keep me on track with my projects following my graduation. Here, you will find an organized folder structure that mirrors the software development lifecycle, offering insights into my project design and management skills.

## Repository Structure
The repository is divided into individual project folders, each representing a specific project I am currently working on. Within each project folder, the contents are further organized according to the various stages of the project development lifecycle:

**Plan:** In this folder, I outline the projectâ€™s objectives, scope, and initial strategies. This stage is critical for defining the overall direction of the project.

**Design:** Here, I present detailed design plans, including system architecture, user interface mockups, and any other relevant documentation that illustrates how I intend to achieve my project goals.

**Develop:** This folder includes code snippets, development notes, and any other materials related to the implementation phase of the project.

**Test:** Contains various test cases, and the results of different testing stages.

**Deploy:** This folder is currently empty but will eventually house deployment strategies and documentation.

## Project Backlogs
Each project folder also contains a Product Backlog, which helps me stay on task and manage my work effectively on a weekly basis. The backlog includes prioritized lists of tasks, features, and enhancements, helping me to maintain focus and ensure steady progress toward project completion.

## Conclusion
This repository is designed to showcase my organizational and project management skills. It can be used as a reference for:

Understanding My Design Process: Explore how I plan, design, develop, test, and deploy software projects.

Project Management Insight: See how I break down complex projects into manageable tasks, tracked through detailed product backlogs.

Learning and Inspiration: Use the folder structure and documentation as inspiration for organizing your projects or gaining insight into best practices for project design.
