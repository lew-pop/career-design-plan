The character has a well-groomed beard and short, stylish hair, preferably dark brown. They are wearing casual but fashionable clothing, such as a fitted t-shirt or hoodie, and jeans.

	The background should be clean and modern, hinting at a home studio setup with soft lighting. There should be elements that suggest they are a content creator, such as a microphone, camera, or a computer with editing software open. The overall aesthetic should be vibrant and engaging, suitable for a social media influencer.
